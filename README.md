# Component Build Specs

The creation of a new cms component will occur in three stages:

I. Create a regular component that is responsive to three screen resolutions: desktop, tablet, mobile.
II. Create a secondary view of the above component used by the CMS to preview live changes to the component
III. Create a menu component containing fields that when changed, dynamically change the values
