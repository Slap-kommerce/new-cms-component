# Component Build Specs

The creation of a new cms component will occur in two stages:<br>

1. Create a regular component that is responsive to three screen resolutions: desktop, tablet, mobile. <br>

<table><tr><td>
    <img src="images/component-desktop.png">
</td></tr></table>

2. Create a secondary view of the above component used by the CMS to preview live changes to the component, and the menu component containing fields from which those changes occur <br>
<table><tr><td>
    <img src="images/component-cms.png">
</td></tr></table>
