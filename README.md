# Component Build Specs

I. The creation of a new cms component will occur in three stages:

1. Create a regular component that is responsive to three screen resolutions: desktop, tablet, mobile.
2. Create a secondary view of the above component used by the CMS to preview live changes to the component
3. Create a menu component containing fields that when changed, dynamically change the values
